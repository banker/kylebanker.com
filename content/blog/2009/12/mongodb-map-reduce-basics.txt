If you're accustomed to working with relational databases, the thought of
specifying aggregations with map-reduce may be a bit intimidating. Here, in the
third in "a series of articles on MongoDB aggregation":http://kylebanker.com/blog/2009/11/mongodb-count-group/, I explain map-reduce.
After reading this, and with a little practice, you'll be able to apply the
map-reduce paradigm to a huge number of aggregation problems.

h3. <strong>A comments example, of course</strong>

Let's start with an example. Suppose we have a collection of comments with the following document structure:


<% uv :lang => "javascript", :theme => "twilight" do -%>
{ text: "lmao! great article!",
  author: 'kbanker',
  votes: 2
}
<% end %>

Here we have a comment authored by 'kbanker' with two votes. Now, we want to find the total number of votes each comment author has earned across the entire comment collection. It's a problem easily solved with map-reduce.

h3. <strong>Mapping</strong>

As its name suggests, map-reduce essentially involves two operations. The
first, specified by our *map* function, formats our data as a series of
key-value pairs. Our key is the comment author's name (this makes sense only if
this username is unique). Our value is a document containing the number of
votes. We generate these key-value pairs by *emitting* them. See below:

<% uv :lang => "javascript", :theme => "twilight" do -%>
// Our key is author's userame; 
// our value, the number of votes for the current comment.
var map = function() {
  emit(this.author, {votes: this.votes});
};
<% end %>

When we run map-reduce, the *map* function is applied to each document. This
results in a collection of key-value pairs. What do we do with these results?
It turns out that we don't even have to think about them because they're
automatically passed on to our *reduce* function.

h3. <strong>Reducing</strong>

Specifically, the *reduce* function will be invoked with two arguments: a key
and an array of values associated with that key. Returning to our example, we
can imagine our *reduce* function receiving something like this:

<% uv :lang => "javascript", :theme => "twilight" do -%>
reduce('kbanker', [{votes: 2}, {votes: 1}, {votes: 4}]);
<% end %>

Given that, it's easy to come up with a reduce function for tallying these votes:

<% uv :lang => "javascript", :theme => "twilight" do -%>
// Add up all the votes for each key.
var reduce = function(key, values) {
  var sum = 0;
  values.forEach(function(doc) {
    sum += doc.votes;
  });
  return {votes: sum};
};
<% end %>

h3. <strong>Results</strong>

So how do we we run it? From the shell, we pass our map and reduce functions to the mapReduce helper:

<% uv :lang => "javascript", :theme => "twilight" do -%>
// Running mapReduce.
var op = db.comments.mapReduce(map, reduce);

{
  "result" : "tmp.mr.mapreduce_1260567078_11",
  "timeMillis" : 8,
  "counts" : {
  "input" : 6,
    "emit" : 6,
    "output" : 2
  },
  "ok" : 1,
}
<% end %>


Notice that running the mapReduce helper returns *stats on the operation*; the
results of the operation itself are stored in a temporary collection. In this
case, that collection is *tmp.mr.mapreduce_1260567078_11*.

The other stats also prove informative. First is the operation time in
milliseconds. Next are the number of input documents, the number of times we
called emit (this can be more than once per document), and the number of output
documents. Finally, we can be assured that the operation has succeeded because "ok" is 1.

Of course, what we really want are the results. To get them, just query the output collection:

<% uv :lang => "javascript", :theme => "twilight" do -%>
// Getting the results from the shell
db[op.result].find();

{ "_id" : "hwaet", "value" : { "votes" : 21 } }
{ "_id" : "kbanker", "value" : { "votes" : 13 } }
<% end %>

h3. <strong>How do I execute map-reduce from Ruby?</strong>

Like this:

<% uv :lang => "ruby", :theme => "twilight" do -%>
# Running map-reduce from Ruby (irb) assuming
# that @comments references the comments collection

# Specify the map and reduce functions in JavaScript, as strings
>> map    = "function() { emit(this.author, {votes: this.votes}); }"
>> reduce = "function(key, values) { " +
  "var sum = 0; " +
  "values.forEach(function(doc) { " +
  " sum += doc.votes; " +
  "}); " +
  "return {votes: sum}; " +
"};"

# Pass those to the map_reduce helper method
@results = @comments.map_reduce(map, result)

# Since this method returns an instantiated results collection,
# we just have to query that collection and iterate over the cursor.
>> @results.find().to_a
=> [{"_id"="hwaet", "value"=>{"votes"=>21.0}}, 
    {"_id"=>"kbanker", "value"=>{"votes"=>13.0}}
   ]
<% end %>


h3. <strong>Practice</strong>

If you've followed along, you should understand the basics of map-reduce in
MongoDB. For all the details on options, "see the docs":http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/MapReduce. For extra practice, fire up the MongoDB shell and experiment away.
