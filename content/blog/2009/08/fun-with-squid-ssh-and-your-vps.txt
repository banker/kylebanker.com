Sometimes, while at home browsing the web, I'll enter an erroneous address and receive my ISP's custom search page - with suggested links - as a response. This is always a little unsettling because it reminds me that all of my network traffic is being mediated, and perhaps recorded, by a powerful media conglomorate.  

If you have a VPS, it's easy to set up your own proxy server, connect securely using SSH, and know that any traffic sniffed by your ISP will be encrypted.

<strong>1. Install and configure Squid.</strong>

If you're running Ubuntu, you can install "Squid":http://www.squid-cache.org/
as follows:

<% uv :lang => "ruby", :theme => "twilight" do %>
sudo apt-get install squid squid-common
<% end %>

Before starting the server, you'll need to make some changes to the squid configuration file
(*/etc/squid/squid.conf*).

First, decide upon a visible_hostname. Squid won't start unless this directive is set.

<% uv :lang => "ruby", :theme => "twilight" do %>
visible_hostname my_funky_proxy_server 
<% end %>

Next, make sure that you allow for all http traffic.

<% uv :lang => "ruby", :theme => "twilight" do %>
http_access allow all
<% end %>

Finally, if you'd like Squid to run on a port other than the default, search for the
http_port directive:

<% uv :lang => "ruby", :theme => "twilight" do %>
http_port 3128
<% end %>

Save your settings and start the squid server.

<% uv :lang => "ruby", :theme => "twilight" do %>
sudo /etc/init.d/squid start
<% end %>

If Squid starts without any errors, you'll have yourself an http proxy server running on port 3128 of your VPS.

*2. Port forwarding with SSH.*

The next step is to initiate a secure connection between a port on your home
computer and port 3128 (or whichever port Squid is running on) on your VPS. Suppose we choose a local port 2600. Then
we can use SSH to connect like so:

<% uv :lang => "ruby", :theme => "twilight" do %>
ssh -N -L 2600:localhost:3128 me@myvps.com
<% end %>

This command connects to myvps.com with the username *me* and, when connected,
forwards port 2600 on my local computer to port 3128 on myvps.com.

*3. Point your web browser to the new secure port.*

If you're using Firefox, open up the preferences, choose *Advanced* > *Network*
> *Settings*.  Choose *Manual proxy configuration*, enter *localhost* as the
> HTTP proxy and 2600 (or whichever local port you configured in the last
> set) as your port.
