Javascript and Hanami are the topics of this post, though they really have
nothing in common aside from being at the forefront of my mind.

See, just the other day, I gave myself the challenge of writing a Tetris clone
using Javascript and CSS. It also happens that I had recently visited the
Brooklyn Botanic Garden to witness the great blossoming ("photos":http://www.flickr.com/photos/dkbanker/sets/72157617408572024/).

The result? A "Hanami-themed version of
Tetris":http://kylebanker.com/projects/hanami, to play in your broweser. "Try
it out!":http://kylebanker.com/projects/hanami.

Incidentally, Javascript's functional paradigm is slick. Genuinely wowed by
this elegant little language. The code is on "github":http://github.com/banker/Hanami/tree/master.
