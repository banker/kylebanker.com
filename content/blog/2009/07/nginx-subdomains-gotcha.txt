I was trying to set up a subdomain, *photos.kylebanker.com*, using "nginx":http://wiki.nginx.org/Main. No problems, until I realized that *.kylebanker.com (e.g., whatever.kylebanker.com) was resolving to the content at photos.kylebanker.com. Here's my initial configuration. Do you see the what's wrong?

<% uv :lang => "ruby", :theme => "twilight", :line_numbers => true do %>
# Redirect all requests containing 'www.kylebanker.com' 
# to 'kylebanker.com' 
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name  www.kylebanker.com;
    rewrite ^(.*) http://kylebanker.com$1 permanent;
}

# Listen for kylebanker.com
server {
        listen   80;
        server_name  kylebanker.com;

        access_log  /var/log/nginx/blog.access.log;

        location / { 
                root   /home/blog/public; 
                index  index.html index.htm; 
        } 
}

# Listen for photos.kylebanker.com
server {
        listen   80;
        server_name  photos.kylebanker.com;

        access_log  /var/log/nginx/photos.access.log;

        location / { 
                root   /home/photos/public; 
                index  index.html index.htm; 
        } 
}

<% end %>

Turns out that I needed to add a wildcard alias. Line 6 should read as follows:

<% code "ruby" do %>
        server_name  kylebanker.com *.kylebanker.com;
<% end %>

Was this simply too obvious to be documented elsewhere?
