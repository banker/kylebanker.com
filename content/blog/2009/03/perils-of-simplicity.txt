Michael Osinski's software helped create the morgage-backed securities that
have undermined our banking system. He reflects on the easy
manipulation of systems we don't wholly understand:

bq. The power we all hold in our hands is shocking, yet
it’s controlled by a few swipes of a finger. The drive to simplify the
user’s contact with the machine has an inherent side effect of
disguising the complexity of a given task. Over time, the users of any
software are inured to the intricate nature of what they are doing.
Also, as the software does more of the “thinking,” the user does less.

How do we reconcile this "shocking" power with the simplicity enabled
by modern software? As more and more human systems submit to control by
software, how do we avoid rendering what's supposed to be too difficult or
too dangerous all too doable?
