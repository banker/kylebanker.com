A cable modem, wireless router, and power strip can still equal a mess under
the desk. A few cheap materials and two hours of enjoyable labor yielded
this from the front:

<div class="clear">
<img src="/assets/content/2009/decluttered_desk_front.jpg" />
</div>

And this underneath: 

<div class="clear">
<img src="/assets/content/2009/decluttered_desk_bottom.jpg" />
</div>

Alas, this clever idea is not my own. Check out "Declutter Your
Desk":http://www.decluttered.com for the original implementation.
