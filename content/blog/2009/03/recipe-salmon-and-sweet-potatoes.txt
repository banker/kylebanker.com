h3. A simple, relatively inexpensive, fancy dinner (and, no, I can't believe I'm posting a recipe to my blog.)

Gourmets can still eat well, even as we enter recession times. Try on this salmon recipe instead of going out; it won't break the bank.

h4. Salmon 

* 2 Salmon steaks
* 4 tbsp mustard (dijon, spicy brown)
* 1 tbsp honey
* 1/2 cup chopped fresh herbs (mostly parsley, with some thyme)
* Parchment paper

Preheat oven to 450F. Mix the mustard and honey. Line a cookie sheet with the parchement paper, placing the Salmon on top. Spread the honey-mustard mixture over the surface of the Salmon steaks and sprinkle with the herbs. Bake around 20 minutes, or until flaky.

h4. Sweet Potatoes

* 4 tbsp unsalted butter (cut into four pieces)
* 2 tbsp heavy cream
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp sugar
* 2lbs sweet potatoes, peeled, quartered, cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices.

Combine the butter, cream, salt, sugar, and potatoes in a medium saucepan. Cover and cook over low heat until the potatoes become mashable, 30-45 minutes. Remove from heat and mash.
