Couple nights back, I was given three minutes to demonstrate MongoDB before a
somewhat large group of people who'd never heard of it. At one minute each,
here are the highlights:

h3. <strong>1. Schema-free documents.</strong>

MongoDB is schema-free; this means that the structure of MongoDB data need not be defined up front.
MongoDB stores data as collections of documents. A document can be thought of
as a JSON object, Python dictionary, or Ruby hash (among other things). Documents are natural,
elegant ways of representing data, and are of the essence of MongoDB.

Suppose we want to download a few tweets.

<% uv :lang => "ruby", :theme => "twilight" do -%>
# DB connection and collection
@db  = Mongo::Connection.new.db(DATABASE_NAME)
@nyc = @db.collection('nyc')
 
(1..5).each do |page|
  Twitter::Search.new('nyc').page(page).each do |tweet|
    @nyc.save(tweet)
  end
end
<% end %>

That gets us the first five pages of 'nyc'-related tweets and saves them to the
our 'nyc' collection in the db. For each tweet, the Twitter gem returns a Ruby
hash, which saves naturally to the database.

h3. <strong>2. Dynamic queries.</strong>

MongoDB speaks the language of documents. We can query for a specific key:

<% uv :lang => "ruby", :theme => "twilight" do -%>
  @nyc = DB.collection('nyc')
  @nyc.find(:username => "hwaet")  
<% end %>

Or on a nested key pointing to an array:

<% uv :lang => "ruby", :theme => "twilight" do -%>
  @nyc.find('user.followers' => {'234352343'})  
<% end %>

We search a field using a regular expression:

<% uv :lang => "ruby", :theme => "twilight" do -%>
  @nyc.find('text' => /z.+/})  
<% end %>

Or query across a date range:

<% uv :lang => "ruby", :theme => "twilight" do -%>
  @nyc.find('created_at' => {'$lte' => Time.now - (60*60*24)}})  
<% end %>

And all of this can be efficient because each collection can define up to 40
secondary indexes:

<% uv :lang => "ruby", :theme => "twilight" do -%>
  @nyc.create_index('from_user') 
<% end %>


h3. <strong>3. Binary Storage</strong>

What if we want to store images, videos, or music? MongoDB stores arbitrary
binary data, too. 

This code goes through our collection of tweets, fetches the user's profile
image, and saves it with the GridFS store (i.e., MongoDB's specification for storing
larger binary objects).

<% uv :lang => "ruby", :theme => "twilight" do -%>
@nyc.find.each do |tweet|
  filename = tweet['from_user'].downcase + ".jpg"
  next if GridStore.exist?(@db, filename)
 
  GridStore.open @db, filename, 'w+' do |file|
    data = open(tweet['profile_image_url']).read
    file.content_type = 'image/jpeg'
    file.puts data
  end
end
<% end %>

If we want to serve those images with sinatra:

<% uv :lang => "ruby", :theme => "twilight" do -%>
get '/images/:id' do
  content_type "image/jpeg"
  filename = params[:id].downcase + ".jpg"
  GridStore.read(DB, filename)
end
<% end %>


h3. <strong>A long three minutes</strong>

All this is to say nothing of production case studies, performance, or paths
to scalability.
