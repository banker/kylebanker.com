"<i>MongoDB in Action</i>":http://manning.com/banker is now in print! This means two things:

# You can read a single book about MongoDB that takes you from total beginner to budding master.
# I can start blogging again. It turns out that book writing is much more intense that I'd imagined.

You can purchase and "download the book from the publisher":http://manning.com/banker right now. ePub and Kindle versions will be available on December 23. If you'd like to read a bit more about the book, check out my "<i>MongoDB in Action</i>
blog":http://mongodb-book.com.

Finishing the book feels much like finishing a marathon. There's deep sense of relief and accomplishment.
Of course, I could not have done it without the support of my family and my amazing colleagues at 10gen.
I'm grateful to all these folks.

The book is dedicated to peace and human dignity. Most technical books aren't dedicated to ideals, but I
feel that working for peace and the dignity of all human beings is as important as ever and that
expressing that, even in a small way, is worthwhile.

If you end up buying the book, many thanks in advance. I sincerely hope that it proves useful, even enjoyable.
