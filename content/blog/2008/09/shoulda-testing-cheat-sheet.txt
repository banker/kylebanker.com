<p><b>Updated 10/1/08</b>: Modified for the release of Shoulda 2.0.</p>

<p><b>Updated 9/26/08</b>: Fixed some typos and omissions.  Added should_route
and should_render_with_layout (Thanks to Dan Croak and Michal Szajbe).</p>

<p>I’ve created a basic Shoulda cheat sheet.  Along with Topfunky’s "Ruby on
Rails Testing Cheat
Sheet":http://nubyonrails.com/articles/ruby-rails-test-rails-cheat-sheet, it
should be a good reference, especially for those migrating from RSpec.</p>
