<p>What’s the best way to annotate an electronic document with revision notes and comments? Mainstream word-processing products include revision tools, but they’re complex and only work in the context of this or that piece of software.</p>

<p>It turns out that the simplest thing that could possibly work also works in all text-editing situations: bracket notation. I first read about bracket notation in an article on the Humanized blog and thought it quite clever.  So, when a friend recently called on me to make some revisions to a letter he’d sent me via email, bracket notation came to mind and fit the bill perfectly.</p>

<p>Not entirely satisfied with the Humanized system, I invented my own derived form. The general formula is as follows:</p>

<p>([old text] [new text] [notes/reviser])</p>

<p>The third bracket, containing any notes or the reviser’s name, is optional.</p>

<p>To demonstrate bracket notation in action, I’ve provided a sample below. The text comes from a slightly modified (for demonstration) passage from Strunk and White.</p>

<blockquote>
<h5>Draft</h5>

<p>The most powerful writing is concise. A sentence should not contain any unnecessary words; a paragraph no unnnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine should have no unnecessary parts.</p>

<h5>With Bracket Notation</h5>

<p>([The most powerful] [Vigorous]) writing is concise. A sentence should ([not contain any] [contain no]) unnecessary words([;] [,]) a paragraph no ([unnecessary] [unnecessary]) sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine ([should have no] []) unnecessary parts ([Well said!]).</p>

<h5>Revised</h5>

<p>Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts.</p>
