We spend quite a lot of time at 10gen <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mongodb-user">supporting MongoDB users</a>. The questions we
receive are truly legion but, as you might guess, they tend to overlap.
We get frequent queries on sharding, replica sets, and
the idiosyncrasies of JavaScript, but the one subject that never fails to appear
each day on our mailing list is indexing.

Now, to be clear, I'm not talking about how to create an index. That's easy. The
trouble runs much deeper. It's knowing how indexes work and having the intuition
to create the best indexes for your queries and your data set. Lacking this
intuition, your production database will eventually slow to a crawl,
you'll upgrade your hardware in vain, and when all else fails, you'll blame both gods and men.

This need not be your fate. You _can_ understand indexing! All that's required is the
right mental model, and over the course of this series, that's just what I hope to provide.

But _caveat emptor_: what follows is a thought experiment. To get the most out of this post,
you can't skim it. Read every word. Use your imagination. Think through the
quizzes. Do this, and your indexing struggles may soon be no more.

h3. Picturing an index

To understand indexing, you need a picture in your head. So imagine a cookbook.
And not just any cookbook. A massive cookbook, five thousand pages long with
the most delicious recipes for every occasion, cuisine, and season with all the good ingredients you
might find at home. _This_ is the cookbook to end them all. Let's call it The
Cookbook Omega.

Now, although this might be best of all possible cookbooks, there are two tiny problems with the Cookbook Omega.
The first is that the recipes are in random order. On page 3,475 you have Australian Braised
Duck, and on page 2 there's Zacatecan Tacos.

That would be mangeable were it not for the second problem: the Cookbook Omega has no index.

<dl class="quiz">
<dt>Quiz:</dt>
<dd>With no index, how do you find the recipe for Rosemary Potatoes in the Cookbook Omega?</dd>

<dt>Answer:</dt>
<dd>Your only choice is to scan through every page of the book
until you find the recipe. If the recipe is on page 3,973, that's how many pages
you have to look through. In the worst case, you have to look at every single
page!</dd>
</dl>

The solution is to build an index.

h3. The recipe search

There are few ways you can imagine searching for a recipe, but the recipe's name
is probably a good place to start. If we create an alphabetical listing at the
end of the book of each recipe's name followed by its page number, then we'll
have indexed the book by recipe name. A few entries might look like this:

<dl>
<dt>Tibetan Yak Soufflé</dt><dd>45</dd>
<dt>Toasted Sesame Dumplings</dt><dd>4,011</dd>
<dt>Turkey à la King</dt><dd>943</dd>
</dl>

As long as we know the name of recipe, or even the first few letters of that
name, we can use this index to quickly find that recipe in the
book. If that's the only way we expect to search for recipes, then our work is
done.

But, of course, this is unrealistic. Because we can also imagine wanting to find
recipes based on the ingredients we have in our pantry. Or perhaps we want to
search by cuisine. For
those cases, we need more indexes.

<dl class="quiz">
<dt>Quiz:</dt>
<dd>With just one index in recipe name, how do you find all the Chicken recipes?</dd>

<dt>Answer:</dt>
<dd>Lacking the proper indexes, you have to scan the entire book, all 5,000 pages. This is true
for any search on ingredients or cuisine.<dd>
</dl>

So, we need to build another index, this time on ingredients. In this index, we have an
alphabetical listing of ingredients each pointing to the page number of recipes
containing that ingredient. The most basic index on
ingredients would thus look like this:

<dl>
<dt>Cashews</dt><dd>3, 20, 42, 88, 103, 1,215...</dd>
<dt>Cauliflower</dt><dd>2, 47, 88, 89, 90, 275...</dd>
<dt>Chicken</dt><dd>7, 9, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84...</dd>
<dt>Currants</dt><dd>1,001, 1,050, 2,000, 2,133...</dd>
</dl>

Is the index you thought you were going to get? Is it even helpful?

This index is good if all you need is a list of recipes for a given ingredient.
But if you have any other information about the recipe that you want to include
in your search, you still have some scanning to do. Once you know the page numbers
where Cauliflower is referenced, you then need to go to each of those pages to get
the name of the recipe and what cuisine it's part of. This is, of course,
better than paging through the whole book, but there are still improvements to
be made.

<dl class="quiz">
<dt>Quiz:</dt>
<dd>You randomly discovered a great chicken recipe in the Cookbook Omega several
months ago, but you've forgotten its name. At this point, there are two indexes, one on recipe
name and the other on ingredients. Can you think of a way to use these two indexes in combination
to find your long lost chicken recipe?</dd>

<dt>Answer:</dt>
<dd>I sure hope not. Think about it. If you start with the index on recipe name, but
don't remember the name of the recipe, then searching this index is little
better than paging through the entire book. If, on the other hand, you start
with the index on ingredients, then you'll have a list of page numbers to check,
but those page numbers can in no way be plugged in to the index on recipe name.
Therefore, you can only use one index in this case, and it turns out that the
one on ingredients is the more helpful of the two.</dd>

<dt>Discussion:</dt>
<dd>We commonly encounter users who believe that searching on two fields can be
facilitated by creating two separate indexes on those fields. This example
should give you some intuition about why this just isn't possible.</dd>
</dl>

Happily, there is a solution to the long lost chicken recipe, and its answer
lies in the use of compound indexes.

h3. Compound indexes

The two indexes we've created so far are single-key indexes: they both order
just one data item from each recipe. We're now going to build out yet another
index for the Cookbook Omega, but this time, instead of using just one data
item, we'll use two. Indexes that use more than one key like this are called compound
indexes.

This compound index uses both ingredients and recipe name, _in that order_. We'll
notate the index like this: <code>ingredient</code>-><code>name</code>. Here's what part of this index would look like:

<dl>
<dt>Cashews</dt>
<dd>
<dl>
  <dt>Cashew Marinade<dt><dd>1,215</dd>
  <dt>Chicken with Cashews<dt><dd>88</dd>
  <dt>Rosemary-Roasted Cashews<dt><dd>103</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dl>
<dt>Cauliflower</dt>
<dd>
<dl>
  <dt>Bacon Cauliflower Salad<dt><dd>875</dd>
  <dt>Lemon-baked Cauliflower<dt><dd>89</dd>
  <dt>Spicy Cauliflower Cheese Soup<dt><dd>47</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dt>Currants</dt>
<dd>
<dl>
  <dt>Creamed Scones with Currants<dt><dd>2,000</dd>
  <dt>Fettuccini with Glazed Duck<dt><dd>2,133</dd>
  <dt>Saffron Rice with Currants<dt><dd>1,050</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>

The value of this index for a human is obvious. You can now search by ingredient
and probably very quickly find the recipe you want. For a machine, it's still
valuable for this use case, but only if we can provide the first letters of the
recipe name, which will keep the database from having to scan every recipe name listed
for that ingredient. This compound index would be especially useful if, as with
the Cookbook Omega, we had several hundred (or thousand) chicken recipes.

<dl class="quiz">
<dt>Quiz:</dt>
<dd>Remember: with compound indexes, order matters. Imagine a compound index on
<code>name</code>-><code>ingredient</code>. Would this index be interchangeable with the
inverse compound index we just explored?</dd>

<dt>Answer:</dt>
<dd>Definitely not. With this index, once we have the recipe name, our search is already
limited to a single recipe, a single page in our cookbook. So if this index were
used on a search for the recipe "Cashew Marinade" and the ingredient "Bananas" then the index could
confirm that no such recipe exists. But that's not exactly our use case.</dd>
</dl>

<dl class="quiz">
<dt>Bonus Quiz:</dt>
<dd>Our cookbook now has three indexes: one on recipe name, one on ingredients, and one
on <code>ingredient</code>-><code>name</code>. With the compound index in place, is it possible to
eliminate either of the first two indexes we created?</dd>

<dt>Answer:</dt>
<dd>Yes! We can safely tear out the single-key index on ingredients. Why? Because a
search that just specifies an ingredient can use the index on
<code>ingredient</code>-><code>name</code>. If we know an ingredient, we can, using that compound
index, easily get a list of all page numbers containing said ingredient. Look again at the
sample entries for this index to see why this is so.</dd>

<dt>Exercise:</dt>
<dd>If we only know the recipe name, why can't we use the index on
<code>ingredient</code>-><code>name</code> to find that recipe's page number?</dd>
</dl>

h3. Selectivity

We're going to cover one more concept that you can use to design better
indexes. It's the idea that some keys for your data will be more selective
than others. Imagine that the recipes in the Cookbook Omega consist of a total
of 200 different ingredients but only represent 12 different cuisines. If the
cookbook contains 5,000 recipes, which key -- ingredients or cuisine -- is more
selective?

Intuitively, it should be easy to see that ingredient narrows the the number of recipes
much more than cuisine does. On averge, there will be 417 (5,000 / 12) recipes per cuisine
but only 125 recipes per ingredient (5,000 / 200 * 5). This assumes an average of five ingredients per recipe, but clearly, the actual selectivity of any given ingredient will always be hard to estimate. Some ingredients (chicken) will be less selective than others (anise). But ingredient is generally the more selective of the two fields.

<dl class="quiz">
<dt>Quiz:</dt>
<dd>Suppose you want to search the Cookbook Omega on both cuisine and
ingredient. You'll need to build a compound index, but the ordering will make a
difference. Which should come first? (Hint: think about selectivity).</dd>

<dt>Answer:</dt>
<dd>You're probably better off building the compound index on
<code>ingredient</code>-><code>cuisine</code>. In addition to providing a more selective first key, this
compound index will actually be useful for queries on ingredient only. It's easy
to see how the inverse compound index on cuisine->ingredient wouldn't be all that useful
for the opposite case, where the search is on cuisine alone. (And of course, we
all know now that queries on a compound index aren't possible if all we have is the second key.)</dd>

<dt>Exercise:</dt>
<dd>Visualize for yourself the difference between the representatons of
<code>ingredient</code>-><code>cuisine</code> and
<code>cuisine</code>-><code>ingredient</code> as they would appear as indexes in the Cookbook Omega.</dd>
</dl>

h3. Lessons and Limits

The goal of this post was to lay a groundwork for readers needing a better mental model of indexes.
Having a solid mental model is always better than
memorizing rules of thumb, but just to help out, here are few concrete lessons that can derived from this thought experiment:

<ul>
  <li>Indexes make for fast retrieval. Without the proper indexes, you're forced
to manually page through your data, which is slow.</li>
  <li>Indexes on a single key cannot be used in combination with one another. For queries that
use multiple keys (e.g., ingredient and recipe name), you need a compound index.</li>
  <li>An index on <code>ingredient</code> can and should be eliminated if you have a second
index on <code>ingredient</code>-><code>cuisine</code>. More generally, if you
have an index on <code>a</code>-><code>b</code>, then
a second index on <code>a</code> alone will be redundant.</li>
  <li>The order of keys in a compound index matters greatly. It's usually better if the
more selective key comes first. (But what's best will always be dicated by the
range of queries you expect to perform.)</li>
  <li>Keep a mind to selectivity. You should probably avoid creating indexes
that aren't very selective, particularly if they're on a single key only.</li>
</ul>

One final note is to bear in mind that the cookbook analogy can be taken only
so far. It's a model for understanding indexes, but it doesn't fully correspond
to the way that B-tree indexes actually work (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree">B-trees</a> are the data structure used to
represent indexes in most databases, including <a
href="http://mongodb.org">MongoDB</a>). The ideas presented
here generally hold true, but if you'd like more nuance, <a href="/blog/feed.xml">stay tuned</a> for the next post,
where I'll introduce B-trees and build on the mental model begun here.
